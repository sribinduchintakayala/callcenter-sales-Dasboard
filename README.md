# Power BI Call Center Dashboard - Project Overview

## Project Objective

This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a dynamic **Power BI** dashboard for analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) within a call center environment. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into critical aspects of call center operations, including agent performance, call trends, customer satisfaction, and issue resolution.

By leveraging data visualization techniques, the dashboard supports better decision-making and operational improvements in a call center setting.

## Key Features

- **Customer Satisfaction Insights**: Provides a comprehensive view of customer sentiment, including the overall satisfaction ratings, helping to identify areas requiring attention and improvement.
  
- **Call Answering and Abandonment Metrics**: Visualizes key call center metrics, such as answered vs. abandoned calls, giving a clear understanding of operational efficiency and resource allocation.

- **Call Trends Over Time**: Analyzes historical trends in call volumes, enabling the identification of peak call times and trends for better staffing and resource management.

- **Agent Performance Evaluation**: Allows a detailed breakdown of agent performance based on metrics like call handling time and resolution rates. This feature helps identify top performers and areas for improvement.

- **Call Topic Analysis**: Categorizes calls by topic and highlights resolution rates, offering insights into frequently encountered issues and how effectively they are being addressed.

## Technical Approach

1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
   - Utilized **Power Query** in Power BI to clean, transform, and shape raw data.
   - Applied **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** techniques to integrate and preprocess the data from multiple sources to ensure consistency and accuracy.

2. **Data Modeling**:
   - Created a robust **data model** by defining relationships between different data tables (e.g., calls, agents, satisfaction ratings) for a comprehensive analysis.
   - Implemented calculated columns and measures using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to create key metrics such as average speed of answer, total calls answered, and unresolved calls.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Designed interactive dashboards with **Power BI** to visualize critical KPIs, allowing stakeholders to analyze data dynamically.
   - Implemented **conditional formatting** and **dynamic filtering** to improve the user experience and provide insights into specific segments (e.g., agent performance, satisfaction level).

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Applied performance optimization techniques such as **query folding**, **aggregations**, and efficient **modeling** practices to ensure quick loading times and responsive dashboards.

5. **Customer Satisfaction Analysis**:
   - Analyzed customer satisfaction using detailed segmentation, such as neutral vs. dissatisfied categories, to determine areas for improvement in call center operations.
   - Integrated **trend analysis** to monitor fluctuations in satisfaction levels over time, ensuring continuous improvement.

## Project Outcomes

- **Actionable Insights**: The dashboard provides managers and decision-makers with actionable insights on agent performance, customer satisfaction, and call trends, which can be used to drive operational improvements.
  
- **Improved Efficiency**: By analyzing performance data, we can optimize staffing and resource allocation, leading to better customer service and reduced wait times.

- **Scalability**: The dashboard is designed to handle large datasets (5,000+ calls) and can be easily scaled for future data growth.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating calculated columns, measures, and custom calculations.
- **Power Query**: For data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
- **Excel**: For initial data cleaning and preparation.
- **GitHub**: For version control and sharing the project.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `.pbix` Power BI file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Interact with the visualizations and explore key performance metrics.
4. Customize the dashboard by connecting it to different datasets or applying additional filters.

## Future Enhancements

- **Predictive Analytics**: Implement predictive models to forecast call volumes, average wait times, and other key metrics.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Enhance the dashboard by integrating real-time data for live monitoring.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Add more granular filtering options such as agent-specific or region-based analysis.

## Conclusion

This project highlights my expertise in data analysis, data modeling, and visualization using **Power BI**. It demonstrates my ability to transform complex data into actionable insights, ultimately helping businesses optimize their call center operations and enhance customer satisfaction.
